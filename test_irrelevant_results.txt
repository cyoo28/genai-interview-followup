Purpose: Testing the OpenAI API call in api_backend.py with an irrelevant candidate answer
Payload:
{
  "question": "Can you describe a project where you implemented AI or machine learning to solve a real-world problem?",
  "answer": "I enjoy playing basketball and hiking on weekends.",
  "role": "AI Engineer",
  "interview_type": [
    "Technical",
    "Screening"
  ]
}

Follow-up: Can you describe a specific AI/ML project you worked on, the real-world problem it addressed, and your role on the team?
Rationale: The original question asked for a project but the candidate's answer discussed hobbies; this asks for the missing project details and their responsibilities.
